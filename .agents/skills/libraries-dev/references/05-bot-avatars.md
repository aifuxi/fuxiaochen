# Bot avatars

Animated 3D bot avatars for AI agents: a glossy body with a living face that looks around, blinks and hops while it works. React, drawn on a 2D canvas (no WebGL, no runtime dependencies). npm package `bot-avatars`.

## When to use

### Where it goes

The author's placement rules. Follow them before the general list below.

- **Anything avatar related for a bot or agent**: assistant avatars in a thread, agent lists and sidebars, agent pickers, job headers and empty-state mascots.
- The state follows the agent's real status (see the status mapping under Common mistakes).

More situations it fits:

- The avatar next to an assistant's reply in a chat thread: `working` while the model streams, idle once the answer lands.
- A roster or sidebar of agents, one body shape per agent, each showing whether it is busy.
- A status chip or header for a background job or agent run ("Booking the venue…").
- An agent picker or onboarding step where the user chooses a bot.
- Empty states and "your agent is on it" screens that need a small character instead of a spinner.

### When not to use

- Human user avatars. Use a photo or initials; these are bots.
- Places that must render with no JavaScript (emails, static OG images). The avatar paints on the client only.
- Dense tables with hundreds of rows animating at once. Each visible avatar is a live canvas.
- A plain loading indicator with no agent behind it. A spinner or skeleton says less and costs less.

## Install

```bash
npm install bot-avatars
pnpm add bot-avatars
yarn add bot-avatars
```

```tsx
import { BotAvatar } from "bot-avatars";
```

- React component only (`<BotAvatar>` renders a `<canvas>`). Peer dependency: `react >= 18`.
- ESM (`dist/index.es.js`) and CommonJS (`dist/index.cjs`) builds, with types.
- No `"use client"` directive ships in the package. In the Next.js App Router, import it from a file that starts with `"use client"`.
- Server rendering works: the server emits an empty canvas, the avatar paints on the client after mount.

The detail page also has two ports, both local to the repo (not on npm):

- React Native: `bot-avatars-native` in `packages/bot-avatars/ports/react-native/bot-avatars-native`, needs `@shopify/react-native-skia react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets`. Expo needs `expo run:ios` / `run:android`.
- SwiftUI (iOS 17+): `BotAvatarsKit` in `packages/bot-avatars/ports/ios/BotAvatarsKit`, added as a local Swift package.

## Basic usage

React, as the page's Install & Usage tab gives it:

```tsx
import { BotAvatar } from "bot-avatars";

<BotAvatar type="clover" state={busy ? "working" : "default"} />;
```

React Native:

```bash
npm install @shopify/react-native-skia react-native-reanimated react-native-worklets
```

```tsx
import { BotAvatar } from "bot-avatars-native";

<BotAvatar type="clover" state={busy ? "working" : "default"} size={64} />;
```

SwiftUI:

```swift
// Package.swift, or Xcode: File > Add Package Dependencies > Add Local...
.package(path: "packages/bot-avatars/ports/ios/BotAvatarsKit")
```

```swift
import BotAvatarsKit

BotAvatar(type: .clover, state: busy ? .working : .default)
```

The playground's live snippet has this shape (only non-default props are written):

```tsx
import { BotAvatar } from "bot-avatars";

<BotAvatar type="star" state="working" size={96} />;
```

| `paused` | `true` / `false`                                                                           | `false`     | Freezes the animation on its current frame.                                                                                                                          |

Tuner to props: the Type, State and Size tabs set `type`, `state` and `size`. The State tab label "Idle" is the value `"default"`. The Play / Pause button on the stage toggles `paused`; the playground loads paused, so its snippet carries `paused` until you press Play. The playground starts at 96 px; the snippet drops `size` at 64 because 64 is the package default, and drops `state` at `"default"`.

State changes are cross-animated: the rig eases from the old pose to the new one, so toggling `state` on every token or tool call is safe.

## Recipes

Thinking state in a chat reply. Use when an assistant message streams in.

```tsx
import { BotAvatar } from "bot-avatars";

function AssistantMessage({
  streaming,
  children,
}: {
  streaming: boolean;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <div className="msg msg--bot">
      <BotAvatar type="clover" state={streaming ? "working" : "default"} size={32} />
      <div className="msg-body">{streaming ? "Thinking…" : children}</div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Agent roster. Use when a sidebar lists several agents and shows which ones are running.

```tsx
import { BotAvatar, type BotAvatarType } from "bot-avatars";

type Agent = { id: string; name: string; avatar: BotAvatarType; busy: boolean; status: string };

function Roster({ agents }: { agents: Agent[] }) {
  return (
    <ul className="roster">
      {agents.map((a) => (
        <li key={a.id}>
          <BotAvatar type={a.avatar} state={a.busy ? "working" : "default"} size={32} />
          <span>{a.name}</span>
          <span className="muted">{a.status}</span>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

Each instance offsets its blink timing from its React id, so a row never blinks in unison.

Wake on hover. Use for a team row or agent picker where the hovered bot comes alive.

```tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { BotAvatar, type BotAvatarType } from "bot-avatars";

const TEAM: BotAvatarType[] = [
  "clover",
  "flower",
  "star",
  "ghost",
  "mech",
  "circle",
  "hexagon",
  "square",
];

function Team() {
  const [hot, setHot] = useState<BotAvatarType | null>(null);
  return (
    <div className="team">
      {TEAM.map((t) => (
        <button key={t} onPointerEnter={() => setHot(t)} onPointerLeave={() => setHot(null)}>
          <BotAvatar type={t} state={hot === t ? "working" : "default"} size={64} />
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Still avatar in a settings card. Use when the bot identifies an agent but should not move (profile, config page).

```tsx
<BotAvatar type="hexagon" size={96} paused />
```

Job header. Use for the header of a long-running agent task.

```tsx
<header className="job">
  <BotAvatar type="mech" state={job.status === "running" ? "working" : "default"} size={64} />
  <h2>{job.title}</h2>
</header>
```

## Accessibility & performance

- The canvas has `role="img"` and a per-state `aria-label` by default: "Clover bot, idle", "Clover bot, working". Pass your own `aria-label` (for example the agent's name and status) and it replaces the default.
- Every other prop is passed straight to the `<canvas>`: `className`, `style`, `data-*`, `aria-*`, event handlers. When the agent's name and status are already shown as text beside the avatar, make it decorative with `aria-hidden` so screen readers do not read them twice.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`: no animation loop runs; the still pose of the current state is drawn. The media query is checked when the component renders, not watched live.
- `paused` stops the loop entirely (no per-frame cost).
- One shared `requestAnimationFrame` loop serves every avatar on the page. Each avatar leaves it when scrolled offscreen (IntersectionObserver), and the loop stops while the tab is hidden.
- Device pixel ratio is capped at 2.
- The default look is a per-pixel material. The first time a body type appears, its form is baked (a few ms, on idle time); a softer look stands in for those frames.
- Clicking an avatar makes it hop and turn round, and its eyes follow a nearby pointer. This is on by default; your own `onClick` still runs.
- Hydration: the server output is an empty `<canvas>` with the same attributes, so there is no mismatch. Nothing paints until JavaScript runs.

## Common mistakes

- Clipping the hop. The canvas is drawn 1.5x the `size` box and pulls itself back with negative margins, so the layout stays exactly `size` square while a hop or flip goes outside it. A tight parent with `overflow: hidden` crops the jump. Leave room above the avatar.
- Sizing with CSS. Set `size`, not `width`/`height`/`margin` in `style` or a class. Those override the overscan box and the negative margins, and the avatar shifts or crops.
- Importing it into a React Server Component. The component uses hooks; put it behind a `"use client"` file.
- Passing an unknown `state` string. It falls back to `"default"` silently. Map your app's statuses yourself:

  | App status                                | Free props                                    |
  | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
  | `running`, `streaming`, `pending`, `busy` | `state="working"`                             |
  | `idle`, `ready`, `online`                 | `state="default"`                             |
  | `offline`, `away`, `disabled`             | `state="default"` with `paused` (a still bot) |

  A dedicated `sleeping` state for offline agents exists in the Pro options.

- Putting the avatar inside a clickable row and being surprised by the hop. A click on the avatar itself triggers it; clicks on the row around it do not.
- Expecting a state to hold a loop: `working` shows while the prop says so. Drive it from your real status (streaming flag, job status), not from a timer.
